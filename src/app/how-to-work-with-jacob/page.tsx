        <p>
          ðŸ‘‹ Hey there! I&apos;m Jacob a <Age /> tech founder. I care a lot
          about building impactful and beautiful products that change
          people&apos;s lives in a positive way. I wanted to share a bit about
          my background and how I like to work.

        <Header text="My Story" />

        <Section>
          <Subheader text="First taste of building products" />

          <Pg text="I first learned to code in 3rd grade, teaching myself PHP. From there, I was hooked. I wrote code every single day through high school. By my sophomore year of college, I had landed my first full-time job at a local startup." />
          <Pg text="In 2015, ahead of the ARKit release, I founded an AR for education startup. It was an incredible learning experience." />
        </Section>

        <Section>
          <Subheader text="Building professionally" />

          <Pg text="My junior year took an unexpected turn when Bridgewater Associates reached out and asked me to come work for them. I moved from my small hometown in South Carolina to Westport, Connecticut, where I had the privilege of learning from some of the smartest people I've ever met." />
          <Pg text="But my founder itch never went away, so I made the move to San Francisco and joined a tiny startup. It was there that I had my first major disagreement with a CEO. I called him a moron for wanting to triple our manufacturing price for only a 20% reduction, especially when our product was already a fraction of the size of our competitors. That disagreement led to me being fired." />
          <Pg text="Interviewing during COVID was a roller coaster. I received offers from Meta, Google, and Netflix, but all were rescinded during the hiring freeze. Later that year, I got offers from NVIDIA and Coinbase. I decided to join NVIDIA to lead a team working on publisher and game dev SDK tools at GeForce Now." />
        </Section>

        <Section>
          <Subheader text="Starting Pluto" />

          <Pg text="On the weekends, I started a project with my middle school best friend. Our goal was to manage our money the way Bridgewater manages their clients' money. We ran into countless problems along the way: API access to brokerage accounts, data processing, backtesting, knowledge sharing." />
          <Pg text="Those challenges led me to leave NVIDIA and start Pluto. We raised a pre-seed, then a seed round. We launched a few products that didn't gain traction, but then we found one that really resonated." />
          <Pg text="And that brings us to today!" />

        <Header text="How I Work" />
        <Section>
          <Subheader text="Communication" />
          <Pg text="I'll be straight with you: I'm not great at async communication. If I don't respond to your email, please ping me again. I much prefer face-to-face conversations whenever possible, even if it's just a quick sync." />
          <Pg text="I'm a firm believer in direct feedback. If you think I'm wrong about something, I want you to tell me. I'll always do the same for you. Disagreement and debate are healthy and necessary for any high-performing team." />
        </Section>
        <Section>
          <Subheader text="Decision Making" />
          <Pg text="I tend to be intuitive and meritocratic in my decision making. I put a lot of weight on good judgment and taste. When someone on my team demonstrates strong instincts, I'm happy to delegate most decision making to them." />
        </Section>
        <Section>
          <Subheader text="Leadership" />
          <Pg text="I strive to be a hands-on leader who is equally focused on strategy and execution. I believe in building small, extremely capable teams. I'm always eager for feedback on how I can improve as a leader and manager." />
