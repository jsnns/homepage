## My Story

### First taste of building products

I first learned to code in 3rd grade, teaching myself PHP. From there, I was hooked. I wrote code every single day through high school. By my sophomore year of college, I had landed my first full-time job at a local startup.

In 2015, ahead of the ARKit release, I founded an AR for education startup. It was an incredible learning experience.

### Building professionally

My junior year took an unexpected turn when Bridgewater Associates reached out and asked me to come work for them. I moved from my small hometown in South Carolina to Westport, Connecticut, where I had the privilege of learning from some of the smartest people I've ever met.

But my founder itch never went away, so I made the move to San Francisco and joined a tiny startup. It was there that I had my first major disagreement with a CEO. I called him a moron for wanting to triple our manufacturing price for only a 20% reduction, especially when our product was already a fraction of the size of our competitors. That disagreement led to me being fired.

Interviewing during COVID was a roller coaster. I received offers from Meta, Google, and Netflix, but all were rescinded during the hiring freeze. Later that year, I got offers from NVIDIA and Coinbase. I decided to join NVIDIA to lead a team working on publisher and game dev SDK tools at GeForce Now.

### Starting Pluto

On the weekends, I started a project with my middle school best friend. Our goal was to manage our money the way Bridgewater manages their clients' money. We ran into countless problems along the way: API access to brokerage accounts, data processing, backtesting, knowledge sharing.

Those challenges led me to leave NVIDIA and start Pluto. We raised a pre-seed, then a seed round. We launched a few products that didn't gain traction, but then we found one that really resonated.

And that brings us to today!

## How I Work

### Communication

I'll be straight with you: I'm not great at async communication. If I don't respond to your email, please ping me again. I much prefer face-to-face conversations whenever possible, even if it's just a quick sync.

I'm a firm believer in direct feedback. If you think I'm wrong about something, I want you to tell me. I'll always do the same for you. Disagreement and debate are healthy and necessary for any high-performing team.

### Decision Making

I tend to be intuitive and meritocratic in my decision making. I put a lot of weight on good judgment and taste. When someone on my team demonstrates strong instincts, I'm happy to delegate most decision making to them.

### Leadership

I strive to be a hands-on leader who is equally focused on strategy and execution. I believe in building small, extremely capable teams. I'm always eager for feedback on how I can improve as a leader and manager.

## Expectations

### Here's what I expect from my colleagues:

- Consistently high-quality work
- Proactive, transparent communication (if you need to go heads down to focus, just let me know in advance, then blow me away with your output)

### In return, here's what you can expect from me:

- Complete transparency on all fronts
- A commitment to teaching you everything I know and connecting you with others who can fill in my knowledge gaps (of which there are many)

## Let's Connect

Consider this a living document. I'll update it based on feedback from the people I work with. If we haven't already, I'd love to schedule a 1:1 to discuss this guide and how we can work together most effectively.

Feel free to reach out anytime. Let's build something great together!
