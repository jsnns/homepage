_This is a follow up to [How We Build 2.0](/thoughts/how-we-build-2-0) after working on [Spawn](https://spawn.co) for a few months._

# The Last Human Medium

> When AI handles every email, writes every document, and runs every business, what's left for humans? Not tasks. Not productivity. _Creation_.

---

## The Great Divergence

Software is splitting into two futures: **AI-operated utilities** that run the world, and **human experiences** that make it worth living in.

The first category—_intelligent utilities_—is already being claimed. OpenAI and Anthropic are building the AI that will do your job. Their agents will manage your calendar, write your code, run your business. They'll do it better than you ever could. **This is not a threat; it's a liberation.**

But here's what everyone misses:

> In five years, 'business software' will be an _oxymoron_.

AIs don't need interfaces—they need APIs. The entire B2B SaaS industry is building for customers that won't exist. When companies become exclusively AIs, when productivity is fully automated, what remains?

**_Humans, creating for humans._**

---

## The Experience Economy

### For the first time in history, you can hand someone not just a photo or video, but an _entire interactive world_.

"Check this out" has never meant more.

**The Creator Evolution:**

- **YouTube** gave everyone a camera
- **Instagram** gave everyone a gallery
- **Spawn** gives everyone a _universe_

This isn't about making apps easier to build. It's about birthing a new medium where technical knowledge is as irrelevant as understanding film chemistry is to posting a TikTok.

> _Experiences are the only content that can't be consumed by AIs._

They require:

- **Presence**
- **Play**
- The irreducibly human act of **_being there_**

### The Critical Question

When your AI assistant can write better, code better, and analyze better than you, _what remains uniquely yours?_

**The answer:**

- The experiences you _create_
- The worlds you _imagine_
- The delight you _spark_ in others

---

## Why Experiences Matter

> In the post-work world that's rapidly approaching, human agency won't be found in _productivity_. It will be found in _play_, in _creation_, in the uniquely human act of making something that matters to someone else.

### What Humans Actually Want

Think about what you _actually_ want from life once AI handles all the tedious work:

1. **Connection** with others
2. **Creative expression**
3. **Meaningful experiences**
4. **Surprise and delight**
5. **A sense of _agency_ and _impact_**

_Experiences_ are how we'll achieve all of this. Not by building utilities—AI has that covered—but by creating worlds worth exploring, moments worth sharing, ideas made tangible and playful.

---

## The Social Physics of Creation

> The best AI in the world can't make your friends care about what it built.

Every experience shared is a _connection_ made. Every world explored together is a _memory_ created. This isn't software—it's **culture**.

### Culture Has Different Physics Than Utility:

| **Utility Values** | **Experience Values** |
| ------------------ | --------------------- |
| Quality            | _Personality_         |
| Perfect            | _Interesting_         |
| Efficiency         | _Delight_             |
| Features           | _Feelings_            |

When everyone can create experiences, when those experiences can blend and evolve, when creation is joyful exploration rather than technical labor—software stops being something we **use** and becomes something we **_express_**.

---

## The Spawn Difference

> Others are making coding easier. We're making it _irrelevant_.

### Our Philosophy

The magic isn't that we generate apps—it's that we generate _possibilities_.

**Four visions from one dream.**

That's not a feature, it's a _philosophy_.

### While Everyone Else Races to Build Better Hammers...

**_We're creating the reason to build._**

Our platform is designed for _exploration_, not execution:

- **Multiple variants** → because experiences should surprise even their creators
- **Watch it build** → because the act of creation should feel _magical_
- **Respawn and remix** → because the best ideas build on each other
- **Social from the start** → because experiences need _audiences_

> Imagine if every TikTok could be remixed into a new universe. If every YouTube video was a world you could enter and reshape. That's the _minimum_ of what's possible.

---

## The Inevitable Future

### We're not building for the world where humans need help working.

**_We're building for the world where humans need help being human._**

As AI absorbs all practical tasks, as companies become networks of AI agents, as traditional work disappears—what remains is the irreducibly human need to:

- _Create_
- _Share_
- _Connect_

> Creation becomes conversation. Every experience spawns more experiences. The platform doesn't just host creativity—it **multiplies** it.

### Why Spawn Thrives When AGI Arrives

This is why Spawn will thrive in the AGI world everyone fears. When machines can do everything, what will humans _choose_ to do?

**They'll choose to create worlds worth sharing.**

_And they'll create them here._

---

## The Last Human Medium

The last human medium isn't just what we'll create with.

**_It's how we'll remember what makes us human._**

---

> In an age where AI can do everything, the only question that matters is: _what will you create for other humans to experience?_

> The answer to that question is **Spawn**.
